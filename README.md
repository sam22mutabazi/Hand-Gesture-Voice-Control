# Hand-Gesture-Voice-Control
🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition & Voice Control System
An advanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system that combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to control system functions without a mouse or keyboard.

🚀 Overview
This project aims to create a seamless touchless interface. By leveraging MediaPipe for high-fidelity hand tracking and SpeechRecognition for voice command processing, the system allows users to interact with their computer through intuitive gestures and verbal instructions.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Computer Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe

Audio Processing: SpeechRecognition, Pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)

Math Logic: NumPy

✨ Features (In Development)
Real-time Hand Tracking: 21-point landmark detection for precise gesture interpretation.

Voice Command Interface: Execute system actions (like opening apps or searching) via voice.

Multi-Modal Control: Simultaneous processing of hand signals and vocal cues.

Custom Gesture Mapping: (Planned) Allow users to define their own hand signs for specific shortcuts.

🗺️ Project Roadmap
[x] Initial Hand Landmark Detection logic.

[x] Voice Recognition engine integration.

[ ] Gesture-to-Action mapping (Volume control, Cursor movement).

[ ] Streamlit Web Integration (Current Stage).

[ ] Optimization for low-latency performance.
